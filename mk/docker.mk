# This Makefile provides several PHONY targets automating the creation, deletion
# and use of the auxiliary container for development and debugging. It also
# bootstraps the build of the different Docker images in use by the project.

# Configure the image flavour to use. FLAVOUR is not defined, then it'll be set to dev.
FLAVOUR ?= dev

# The directory where all our Dockerfiles (and dependencies) are
DOCKERFILES_PATH := dockerfiles

# Get a hold of the current directory so as to mount the volume with an absolute path.
# Otherwise Docker will try to create its own volume, at least on Docker Desktop-based
# platforms.
PWD = $(shell pwd)

# Unclutter the target recipes a bit by pulling information out.
CONTAINER_IMAGE = ghcr.io/scitags/flowd-go:$(FLAVOUR)-v2.0
CONTAINER_NAME = flowd-go

# Now, what do each of these flags do?
#                       -d: Run the container in the background. It'll be kept alive by the bash session we trigger.
#                       -t: Allocate a pseudo-TTY so that bash doesn't exit as soon as it's launched. Otherwise, the conatiner would quit and
#                           we'd have nothing to attach to later!
#                     --rm: Delete the container once we exit to help with the cleanup.
# -v $(PWD):/root/flowd-go: This will mount the current directory (i.e. the flowd-go repo) under /root/flowd-go in the container.
#      --cap-add SYS_ADMIN: Add the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability to the container which allows us to do a bunch of stuff. Check capabilities(7).
#            --cap-add BPF: Add the CAP_BPF capability which, unsurprisingly, allows loading BPF programs into the kernel. Bear in mind
#                           this capability exists since Linux 5.8: it was part of CAP_SYS_ADMIN before!
#      --cap-add NET_ADMIN: Add the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, allowing us to create the qdiscs to attach the BPF programs to.
# --name $(CONTAINER_NAME): Give the container a deterministic name (i.e. flowd-go) so that the following commands are reproducible.
#       $(CONTAINER_IMAGE): The purposefully built image we are going to run.
#                     bash: The command to run (i.e. a regular bash shell).
# Now, we'll also mount the debugfs filesyste automatically so that we don't rely on the users doing it themselves and/or
# the user creating a persistent volume beforehand with:
#     $ docker volume create --driver local --opt type=debugfs --opt device=debugfs debugfs
# At any rate, check https://hemslo.io/run-ebpf-programs-in-docker-using-docker-bpf/ for a bit more context
