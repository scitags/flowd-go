# NAME
flowd-go - SciTags Flowd-go Daemon

# SYNOPSIS
`flowd-go [-h | --help] [--conf CONFIG_FILE_PATH] [--log-level=info] [run | version | help]`

# DESCRIPTION
The flowd-go daemon will listen for flow events through its various plugins and exert the actions as defined in its several
backends. For instance, if a new flow is defined the eBPF backend will modify the IPv6 flow label of datagrams until that
same flow is stopped.

In the context of flowd-go a *flow* is usually represented as a 5-tuple including the source and destination IPv{4,6} addresses and
ports together with the transport (i.e. L4) protocol. Through *flow events* one can instruct flowd-go to either keep track or
ignore these flows.

Given their complexity, explaining the internals of the different plugins and backends is out of the scope of this manpage.
A simple overview of each of them will be presented and the reader is encouraged to query the implementation along with the
accompanying documentation files presented as Markdown (i.e. `*.md`) documents.

Given flowd-go's purpose, it is intended to be a long-running service (i.e. a *daemon*). This explains why this service can
be managed through SystemD by interacting with the `flowd-go` unit by means of `systemctl(1)`.

The implementation can be found at https://github.com/scitags/flowd-go.

# OPTIONS
`-h, --help`

:   Show the help message and exit.

`--conf CONFIG_FILE_PATH`

:   Provides the path of the configuration file. If left unspecified, it will default to `/etc/flowd-go/conf.json`.
    The syntax of the configuration file is explained in the **CONFIGURATION** section.

`--log-level=info`

:   Controls the logging verbosity. By default only messages with a verbosity of `info` and higher will be printed.
    This option must be one of `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error`. If a wrong level is specified the default of
    `info` will be used.

# COMMANDS
`help`

:   Show the help message and exit.

`version`

:   Show the hash of the built commit and exit.

`run`

:   Run the flowd-go daemon.

# PLUGINS
This section lists the configuration options available for each of the provided plugins. For a deeper explanation please
refer to the documentation accompanying the implementation, which can be found on the URL provided in the DESCRIPTION. The
setting's value type is enclosed in brackets (`[]`) and its default value is enclosed in braces (`{}`).

## np
The **named pipe** plugin will create a FIFO through a call to `mkfifo(3)` on which it will listen for flow events. Available
settings are:

- **maxReaders [int] {5}**: Size of the notification channel's buffer so that a high rate of writes to the named pipe doesn't
  cause the loss of events. Unless the named pipe plugin is intended to be subject to a high load
  this value should be okay.

- **buffSize [int] {1000}**: The size of the buffer (in bytes) writes to the named pipe are read into. The default value should
  be more than enough, but if flow events are extremely large increasing this value could help.

- **pipePath [string] {"/var/run/flowd-go/np"}**: The path on which to create the named pipe.

## api
The **API** plugin will create an HTTP server providing a REST API through which one can send flow events. Please refer to the
documentation provided with the implementation for information on how to interact with the provided API endpoints.

- **bindAddress [string] {"127.0.0.1"}**: The address to bind the server to in the format. As usual `"0.0.0.0"` will make the server listen on
  every available interface configured with an IPv4 address. You can also provide an IPv6 address.

- **bindPort [int] {7777}**: The port to bind the server to. Bear in mind this value **MUST** be equal to o lower than `65535` as ports are
  represented with 16-bit unsigned integers.

# BACKENDS
This section lists the configuration options available for each of the provided backends. For a deeper explanation please
refer to the documentation accompanying the implementation, which can be found on the URL provided in the DESCRIPTION. The
setting's value type is enclosed in brackets (`[]`) and its default value is enclosed in braces (`{}`).

## ebpf
The **eBPF** plugin will mark IPv6 datagrams by setting the value of the *flow label* in its header. This plugin relies on an eBPF program
hooked on a *clsact qdisc* which only deals with egress datagrams. The loading and communication with the eBPF program is managed with
`libbpf`. There are many more (interesting) details in the backend's documentation.

- **targetInterface [string] {"lo"}**: The interface to hook the eBPF program on. This interface should be the outbound interface of the machine
  (i.e. the one pointed to by the default route as given by `ip-route(8)`). The interface name should be one of the values presented by
  `ip-link(8)`.

- **removeQdisc [bool] {true}**: Whether to remove the qdisc (see `tc(8)`) implicitly created to hook the eBPF program. Unless you have a very
  good reason to, don't reconfigure this value as doing so might leave the system in a 'dirty' state after flowd-go exits. In order to remove
  the qdisc manually you can run:

        $ tc qdisc del dev <targetInterface> clsact

  Where `targetInterface` is the one configured with the previous option.

- **programPath [string] {""}**: The path to an eBPF program to load instead of the one embedded into flowd-go. This program should have been compiled
  in a particular way as the loading into the kernel won't work otherwise. Please refer to the eBPF documentation bundled with the implementation
  to take a look at how the embedded program is compiled.

- **markingStrategy [string] {"flowLabel"}**: The marking strategy to leverage on the eBPF program. This option must be one of the following if
  configured, otherwise flowd-go will refuse to start. Available marking strategies are:

    - `"flowLabel"`: The eBPF program embeds the flow information in the IPv6 header's *Flow Label* field as defined in SciTags' technical specification.
    - `"hopByHopHeader"`: The eBPF programs adds a *Hop-by-Hop Options* extension header encoding the flow information.
    - `"hopByHopDestHeaders"`: The eBPF programs adds a *Hop-by-Hop Options* and a *Destination Options* extension header encoding the flow information.

- **debugMode [bool] {false}**: Whether to load an eBPF program compiled with debug support. This option **should be false on production** environments.
  The many calls to `bpf_printk` preset if compiled with debugging support can have an effect on performance. You have been warned!

## firefly
The **Firefly** backend will send UDP fireflies as defined in https://www.scitags.org. These are basically UDP datagrams including a JSON-formatted
payload including flow information.

- **fireflyDestinationPort [int] {10514}**: The destination port of the UDP fireflies. Bear in mind this value should be equal to or lower than
  `65535` as ports are represented with 16-bit unsigned integers.

- **prependSyslog [bool] {false}**: The technical specification states that an initial bit of information containing syslog-parsable information should
  be prepended to the JSON payload. When developing and debugging these payloads the header 'gets in the way' and so one can turn it off. However,
  in a production scenario this setting should be `true`.

# CONFIGURATION
Flowd-go's configuration is defined through a JSON file which by default will be `/etc/flowd-go/conf.json`. A different
path can be specified through the `--conf` option.

Please note **every** configuration parameter is optional. The configuration parsing logic can tell wether an option
has been configured and, if not, a default value is applied. Bear in mind plugins and backends **MUST** be included in the
configuration file, but their associated options can be an empty object (i.e. `{}`). The following are examples of
valid configurations:

    # Apply the default settings to everything. No plugins or backends will be instantiated though...
    {}

    # Use default settings for everything, but do instantiate an api plugin and the ebpf and firefly backends
    {
        "plugins": {
            "api: {}
        },
        "backends": {
            "ebpf": {},
            "firefly": {}
        }
    }

If setting `--log-level=debug` you will get a glimpse of what is actually parsed so that you can check whether it's what
you expect or not.

The following details the available configuration options. The setting's value type is enclosed in brackets (`[]`) and
its default value is enclosed in braces (`{}`).

**pidPath [string] {"/var/run/flowd-go.pid"}**

:   The path where the main process' PID will be written.

**workDir [string] {"/var/cache/flowd-go"}**

:   The directory where flowd-go will drop cache's and otherwise persistent files.

**stunServers [array of string] {[]}**

:   Additional STUN servers to leverage for outbound IPv4 address discovery. Flowd-go already has a couple
    of STUN servers defined so this option can be left empty. If providing one, the expected format is
    `stun:<stun-server-hostname>:<stun-server-port>`. For instance, the following would be completely
    valid: `stun:stun.services.mozilla.org:3478`.

**plugins [object]**

:   This object defines the plugins to instantiate as well as their configuration. The object's keys **MUST**
    be the identifier of the desired plugin and the associated values are objects representing each plugin's
    particular configuration. The details of these per-plugin configurations can be found on the PLUGINS
    section. If key specifying a non-existent plugin is included, flowd-go will refuse to start and print
    a (hopefully) informative error indicating the problem.

**backends [object]**

:   This object defines the backends to instantiate as well as their configuration. The object's keys **MUST**
    be the identifier of the desired backend and the associated values are objects representing each backend's
    particular configuration. The details of these per-backend configurations can be found on the BACKENDS
    section. If key specifying a non-existent backend is included, flowd-go will refuse to start and print
    a (hopefully) informative error indicating the problem.
